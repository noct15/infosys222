An art museum owns a large volume of works of art. Each work of art is identified by an item code. Each work can be described using a title, the size â€“ composed of height, width and weight. A work of art is developed by an artist. The artist of some works is not known. An artist is identified by an artist number and described by name, age, gender, dob and dod (null for living artists!). Only data about artists for works currently owned by the museum are kept in the database. At any time, an art work is either displayed in the museum, held in storage, away from the museum as part of a travelling show, or on loan to another gallery. If on display the location of the display (in the museum) is noted. A travelling show is described by a show ID, city in which the show is currently appearing, and the start and end dates of the show. Many of the museum works can be part of a given show. One art work can be displayed in many shows over time. These need to be recorded for future analysis. A gallery is described by a gallery identifier, name and city. The museum wants to retain a history of all works of art loaned to another gallery. The date loaned and the date returned must be recorded and retained.
